Hello and welcome to my repository!

SENIOR DESIGN PROJECT: My senior design project was a miniature robot that swims using surface
	acoustic wave streaming. The final pitch slides and poster are given in this directory,
	while Inventor and MATLAB files are stored in the appropriately named directories. My
	primary responsibility for the project was optimizing the SAW streaming, which encompassed
	designing and manufacturing the Interdigital Transducers and 3D printed structure. 

INVENTOR: this directory contains the AutoDesk Inventor files I used to design, manufacture, and
	present the 3D printed structure of the bot.

MATLAB: this directory contains code that was used for my senior design project and faculty
	research. Look inside for a more detailed README.

LABVIEW: this directory contains code that was used to automate electro-polling experiments for
	simulating neuro-plasmonic signal detection and microfluidic experiments for detecting
	HIV and other pathogens. Look inside for a more detailed README.

PCB/Distributed_Crosstalk_Project: For the final project of my High-Speed Digital Design class, I
	designed a custom experiment on an FR-4 printed circuit board that investigates the effects
	of distributed crosstalk on digital signals.

PSIM: this directory contains simulations of some power conversion systems I investigated as part of
	my power electronics class.
